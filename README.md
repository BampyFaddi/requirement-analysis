# requirement-analysis
A learning and documentation repository for exploring Requirement Analysis in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). It covers the definition, importance, key activities, types of requirements, use case diagrams, and acceptance criteria, using a booking management system as a case study.
# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository contains learning material and examples related to Requirement Analysis in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).  
The purpose of this repository is to document key concepts, activities, and examples of requirement analysis, particularly in the context of a booking management system case study.
## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, gathering, and analyzing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system.  
It acts as the foundation of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) by ensuring that the final product meets business goals, user expectations, and technical feasibility.

Through requirement analysis, developers and analysts capture **what the system should do** and **how it should behave**. It bridges the communication gap between stakeholders (such as clients, users, and managers) and the development team.

In summary, requirement analysis ensures that the software is built with a clear understanding of:
- The problem to be solved.
- The features to be included.
- The constraints to be respected.
- The success criteria to be achieved.
## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is a critical step in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) because it lays the groundwork for the entire project. Without it, software teams risk building systems that do not meet user needs or business objectives.  

Here are three key reasons why it is important:

1. **Prevents Misunderstandings**  
   Clear requirements ensure that all stakeholders (clients, users, and developers) share the same understanding of what the system should do. This reduces miscommunication and costly rework later.

2. **Guides Design and Development**  
   Well-documented requirements serve as a roadmap for developers and designers, helping them create features that align with business goals and user expectations.

3. **Ensures Quality and User Satisfaction**  
   Requirement Analysis establishes measurable criteria for testing and validation, ensuring the final product works as intended and satisfies user needs.
