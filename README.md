# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository contains learning material and examples related to Requirement Analysis in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).  
The purpose of this repository is to document key concepts, activities, and examples of requirement analysis, particularly in the context of a booking management system case study.
## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, gathering, and analyzing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system.  
It acts as the foundation of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) by ensuring that the final product meets business goals, user expectations, and technical feasibility.

Through requirement analysis, developers and analysts capture **what the system should do** and **how it should behave**. It bridges the communication gap between stakeholders (such as clients, users, and managers) and the development team.

In summary, requirement analysis ensures that the software is built with a clear understanding of:
- The problem to be solved.
- The features to be included.
- The constraints to be respected.
- The success criteria to be achieved.
